# TODO

1. Share link should look like an button. 
2. The share button onclick should override the link call with the share api. So it is easier to send the link to another device.
2. Can i force landscape of the media stream even if the display is holding in portrait mode?
3. Give a nice color (red/green) to indicate, if streaming is currently enabled.
4. Update Readme.md
